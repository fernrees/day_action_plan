## Disclaimer
- You might disagree with us.
- That's cool!
- We can still be friends.

*** =pnotes

This is the part where we give the disclaimer that nobody is an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù; different times call for different kinds of activity and engagement. We are putting forward a particular politics-- one that is uninterested in working in electoral politics and is disillusioned by gradual change. We believe in revolution-- we want to live in a society free of capitalism, the state, and all systems of oppression. To get there, however, we have to work together to build power so that we can break our chains and run our world...or something.

## Pre-Planning Infrastructure

--- &twocolfoot

## Keeping in Mind: Goals, Strategies, & Tactics

*** =left

- **Goal:** The end state you want realized through your action.
- **Strategy:** How, generally speaking, will we achieve our goal?
- **Tactic:** How, in the short term, are we working towards our goal?

*** =right

>- Out of these goals, strategies, and tactics develop:
  >- Risk model
  >- Communication plan
  >- Role assignment
  >- Documentation

--- &footer

## Keeping in Mind: Goals, Strategies, & Tactics üó£

- Small breakout groups
- Choose a goal, strategy, and action tactic.
- This will serve as a practice action for the remainder of the training.  

--- &footer

## Keeping in Mind: Goals, Strategies, & Tactics

- You should hold a meeting or series of meetings leading up to an action. 
- Organizers who may take on key roles should attend.  
- The goals, strategy, and tactics deployed should be figured out at this meeting. 
- The single most important thing that goes into the planning of any direct action is to formulate a specific goal, and to establish benchmarks for declaring victory. 

--- &footer

## Communication

- Prioritize in-person and over the phone communication where possible.
- Weigh meeting participation wtih day of responsibilities.
- Set up a separate signal loop for communication leading up to the action. This should be restricted to only members that have explicitly expressed interest in the action and should be separate from existing loops.
- Use signal‚Äôs disappearing messages to insure any information you don‚Äôt want to share publicly is removed before the day of the action. Starting with 1 day, 12 hours, 1 hour, 5 mins (day of), etc.

--- &twocolfoot

## Taking Stock of your Group

*** =left 

- What is our capacity? 
- Do we have enough people to pull this off? 
- Consider that all roles will need shifts if it‚Äôs ongoing.

*** =right

- Escalated actions if demands aren‚Äôt met

  - day-of jail support
  - obtaining legal support

  - court support
  - further media opportunities at court dates

--- &twocolfoot

## Documentation 

*** =left

- Make sure you have the area(s) where your action will take place well scouted.
- Assume some participants won‚Äôt have the same knowledge of the area that you have. Print out maps of the area and mark important landmarks. Distribute the maps digitally and in person, but consider security around the document.
- Decide on a meeting spot if you were to be separated.

## Day of Roles 

--- &twocolfoot

## Day of Roles: Emergency Decision Making Group

*** =left

- This group is tasked with making decisions for the group as a whole. 
- This person or group should be elected at the planning meeting based on experience, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
- This is the only group that should make important decisions for the action: whether to continue, end, change directions, etc. 
- Participants should know who the members of this group are, and be able to refer people (not police) to them. 

*** =right

## Day of Roles: Media Liason

*** =left

- The role of the media liaison is to identify and distinguish among sympathetic, neutral, and hostile media at an action. 
- The liaison should initiation contact with non-hostile media and attempt to shape their coverage with a concise focus on our talking points. 
- At the beginning of an action and periodically thereafter, the MC should publicly identify the media liaison(s) and strongly encourage our members to refer all requests by media to the liaison.

--- &twocolfoot

## Day of Roles: Police Liason

*** =left

- The job of a police liaison is to concentrate police attention away from the action or demonstration action, to extend the length of the strike action by delaying threats of police action, and through many other types of actions. 
- A police liaison should keep in  mind the agreed-upon goals of the action and adjust accordingly. 
- The most important job of the police liaison is to keep the police as calm and occupied as possible, ideally physically away from the action.

*** =right

--- &twocolfoot

## Day of Roles: Deescalators

*** =left

- During an action, the role of the deescalators is to prevent hecklers or other hostile actors from disrupting the action action.
- The deescaltor's role may entail distracting or otherwise redirecting the attention of hostile actors by engaging them in conversation. 
- If this de-escalation tactic doesnt work, one may need to aggressively drown out hecklers. 
- When engaging hostile actors, interrupters should always be alert to the possible presence firearms or other weapons.

## Day of Roles: NLG

*** =left

- NLG is designed to enable people to express their political views as fully as possible without unconstitutional disruption or interference by the police and with the fewest possible consequences from the criminal justice system. 
- Guild attorneys often provide legal defense for protesters who are arrested and bring civil litigation if needed.
- Legal Observers are typically, but not exclusively, law students, legal workers and lawyers who may or may not be licensed locally.
